    "### Rosenbrock function\n",
    "In mathematical optimization, the Rosenbrock function is a non-convex function, introduced by Howard H. Rosenbrock in 1960, which is used as a performance test problem for optimization algorithms. It is also known as Rosenbrock's valley or Rosenbrock's banana function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The global minimum is inside a long, narrow, parabolic shaped flat valley. To find the valley is trivial. To converge to the global minimum, however, is difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function originally has two parameters, $a$ and $b$ but in this case we will set $a = 1.5$ and $b = 0.25$. We know that the global optimum is found in $(a, a^2)$. The function in our case is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x, y) = (a - x)^2 + b(y - x^2)^2 = (1.5 - x)^2 + 0.25(y - x^2)^2. $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the levels sets on this function on the square [-10,10] x [-10, 10]. Then for the square [-2.5, 2.5] x [-2.5, 2.5], plot this function in 3D, also plot its levels sets (this is a plot in 2D). For the contours plot the point $(a, a^2)$ as well. Use this colormap 'cet_linear_bgy_10_95_c74_r' ."
